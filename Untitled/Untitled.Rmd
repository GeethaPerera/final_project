# Introduction
I am Geetha Perera, a Research Technician with Agriculture and Food based in Canberra. At present I am a part of the Soil Constraint research team in the Crops Program.  I had no experience in R before Data School, tried to self-learn but never happened.  I have been using Excel extensively to record, summarise and visualise data mostly using bar graphs.  My main aim in Data School was to learn coding with R to replace the repetitive steps that I do with data sets in Excel.  Data school FOCUS was a great learning experience for me and I am amazed to see how helpful R is for tidying up and visualising data which allows us seeing an in-depth picture. 

# My Project
Aluminium toxicity is one of the main stresses to plants in acid soils which limits yields of major crops in Australia.    Use of Aluminium resistant crops is one strategy to enable production in these soils in addition to soil management strategies such as liming. In a transgenic approach to increase the tolerance to Aluminium in canola, transgenic canola lines have been produced in CSIRO by transforming the canola cultivar Oscar with two genes related to aluminium tolerance one from wheat (_TaALMT1_) and/ or barely (_HvAACT1_).

Seedlings of T1 and T2 families of transgenic lines were screened in a series of hydroponic experiments (Figure 1) to investigate the effect of aluminium concentration on the early growth and to select any better lines to screen in further experiments.  In each experiment seedlings were grown for two weeks in three concentrations of aluminium (0 µM, 5 µM and 1 0µM) and data on length of the longest root (Figure 2), total root length (by scanning using WinRhizo), shoot dry weight and root dry weight were collected (Table 1).

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='50%', fig.cap="Set up of the hydroponic experiments"}
knitr::include_graphics('resources/img/setup.jpg')
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='50%', fig.cap="length of the longest root"}
knitr::include_graphics('resources/img/measure_root.jpg')
```

For the data school project, I selected one experiment (Experiment 39) to summarise and visualise data with the aim of repeating this process to look at the data of the other experiments. One T1 generation canola line (T1 3672-19) and its T2 generation line (T2 3672-19-1) with Oscar (as the control) were screened in this particular experiment. 


## Preliminary results

Table 1 shows the format of data after cleaning up, tidying and reorganising using R.


```{r tidy_data, eval=TRUE, results='hide'}

#tidying up data

long_root <- read_excel("data/experiment_39.xlsx", sheet="long_root")%>% 
  gather(treatment,longest_root, "0 µM", "5 µM", "10 µM") %>% 
  mutate(longest_root=as.numeric(longest_root))
long_root$treatment <- factor(long_root$treatment,levels = c("0 µM", "5 µM", "10 µM"))

long_root 

shoot_dw <- read_excel("data/experiment_39.xlsx", sheet="shoot_dw") %>% 
  gather(treatment,shoot_dw, "0 µM", "5 µM", "10 µM") %>% 
  mutate(shoot_dw=as.numeric(shoot_dw))
shoot_dw$treatment <- factor(shoot_dw$treatment,levels = c("0 µM", "5 µM", "10 µM"))

shoot_dw

root_dw <- read_excel("data/experiment_39.xlsx", sheet="root_dw") %>% 
  gather(treatment,root_dw,"0 µM", "5 µM", "10 µM")%>% 
  mutate(root_dw=as.numeric(root_dw))

root_dw 

root_length <- read_excel("data/experiment_39.xlsx", sheet="root_length") %>% 
  gather(treatment,root_length,"0 µM", "5 µM", "10 µM")%>% 
  mutate(root_length=as.numeric(root_length))
root_length$treatment <- factor(root_length$treatment,levels = c("0 µM", "5 µM", "10 µM"))
root_length

ex39_combined <- bind_cols(long_root,shoot_dw,root_dw,root_length) 
ex39_combined
view(ex39_combined)

# tidy data to be used for plots and analysis
ex39 <-select(ex39_combined,1,2,3,4,8,12,16) %>% 
  mutate(total_dw=shoot_dw+root_dw)%>% 
  filter(longest_root != "-",shoot_dw !="-", root_dw !="-", root_length!='_', total_dw != '-')
ex39
view (ex39)

```


```{r mytable, out.width='100%', echo = F}
ex39_data <- ex39 %>% 
  select(genotype, treatment, plant_no, longest_root, shoot_dw, root_dw, root_length, total_dw) %>% rename(`Line`= genotype, `Aluminium concentration` = treatment,`seedling number` = plant_no, `longest root length (mm)` = longest_root,`shoot dry weight (mg)` =shoot_dw,`root dry weight (mg)`= root_dw,`total root length (cm)` = root_length, `total dry weight (mg)`= total_dw) 

knitr::kable(head(ex39_data, n = 5), format = "html", caption = "Plant growth data collected at harvest") %>% 
  kable_styling("striped")
```

Raw data for dry weights, length of the longest root and total root length are shown using boxplots in Figures 3 and 4 respectively.  Showing data in this form helped to pick up the outliers easily and to see a broad picture of the response of each line to each level of Aluminium. 

```{r, dry_weights, eval=TRUE, echo= FALSE, results='hide'}
# shoot dry weight

sdw <- ggplot(data=ex39, aes(x=genotype, y=shoot_dw, colour=treatment))+geom_boxplot()+facet_wrap(~treatment)

sdw_final <- sdw+
  labs(title="Shoot dry weight", x= "line name", y="shoot dry weight (mg)")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme (axis.text = element_text(size = 6, angle = 90),
         axis.title = element_text(size = 8),
         plot.title = element_text(size = 10),
         strip.text = element_text(size = 6))


# root dry weight

rdw <- ggplot(data=ex39, aes(x=genotype, y=root_dw, colour=treatment))+geom_boxplot()+facet_wrap(~treatment)


rdw_final <- rdw+
  labs(title="Root dry weight", x= "line name", y="root dry weight (mg)")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme (axis.text = element_text(size = 6, angle = 90),
         axis.title = element_text(size = 8),
         plot.title = element_text(size = 10),
         strip.text = element_text(size = 6))

# total dry weight

tdw <- ggplot(data=ex39, aes(x=genotype, y=total_dw, colour=treatment))+geom_boxplot()+facet_wrap(~treatment)

tdw_final <- tdw+
  labs(title="Total dry weight", x= "line name", y="total dry weight (mg)")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme (axis.text = element_text(size = 6, angle = 90),
         axis.title = element_text(size = 8),
         plot.title = element_text(size = 10),
         strip.text = element_text(size = 6))
```


```{r 3, out.width='60%', fig.align='center', fig.height= 6, fig.width=8, fig.cap="Dry weights",eval=TRUE, echo= FALSE, results='show'}

# final boxplot for dry weights 

final_plot_dw <- plot_grid(sdw_final+theme(legend.position ="none"), rdw_final+theme(legend.position ="none"), tdw_final+theme(legend.position ="none"))
final_plot_dw
```

Figure 2 shows the length of the longest root, and total root length in each of the genotype in each treatment of Aluminum. 

```{r, root_length, eval=TRUE, echo= FALSE, results='hide'}

# length of longest root

long_root<- ggplot(data=ex39, aes(x=genotype, y=longest_root, colour=treatment))+geom_boxplot()+facet_wrap(~treatment)

long_root_final <- long_root+
  labs(title="length of longest root", x= "line name", y="root length (mm)")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme (axis.text = element_text(size = 6, angle = 90),
         axis.title = element_text(size = 8),
         plot.title = element_text(size = 12),
         legend.title = element_text(size = 10),
         strip.text = element_text(size = 6))

rt_length <- ggplot(data=ex39, aes(x=genotype, y=root_length, colour=treatment))+geom_boxplot()+facet_wrap(~treatment)

rt_length_final <- rt_length+
  labs(title="Total root length", x= "line name", y="root length (cm)")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme (axis.text = element_text(size = 6, angle = 90),
         axis.title = element_text(size = 8),
         plot.title = element_text(size = 12),
         legend.title = element_text(size = 10),
         strip.text = element_text(size = 6))

```

```{r 4, out.width='60%', fig.align='center', fig.height= 4, fig.width=6, fig.cap="length of the longest root and total root length"}
# final boxplot for root lengths 

final_plot_rl <- plot_grid(long_root_final+theme(legend.position ="none"),rt_length_final+theme(legend.position ="none"))
final_plot_rl
```

Data on means and standard errors calculated for each line at each concentration of Aluminium for each variable are listed in Table 2.  No effort was made to remove outliers before summarising as the T1 and T2 generations are still segregating and it is possible to show see extremes.  These data were also plotted using R but not displayed in this report.  None of the transgenic lines screened in this particular experiment seems to be performing better in the Aluminium treatments when compared with the control. 

```{R, stats,eval=TRUE, results='hide'}

# Calculating means and standard error

ex39_stats <- ex39 %>%
  group_by(genotype, treatment) %>% 
  summarise (num_rows = n(),
             Avg_long_root = mean(longest_root),
             med_long_root= median(longest_root),
             sd_long_root=sd(longest_root),
             se_long_root=(sd_long_root)/sqrt(num_rows),
             Avg_shoot_dw = mean(shoot_dw),
             sd_shoot_dw=sd(shoot_dw),
             se_shoot_dw=(sd_shoot_dw)/sqrt(num_rows),
             Avg_root_dw = mean(root_dw),
             sd_root_dw=sd(root_dw),
             se_root_dw =(sd_root_dw)/sqrt(num_rows),
             Avg_root_length = mean(root_length),
             sd_root_length=sd(root_length), 
             se_root_length= (sd_root_length)/sqrt(num_rows),
             Avg_total_dw = mean(total_dw),
             sd_total_dw=sd(total_dw),
             se_total_dw= (sd_total_dw)/sqrt(num_rows))
```

```{r mytable2, out.width='100%', echo = F}
ex39_stats_data <- ex39_stats %>%
